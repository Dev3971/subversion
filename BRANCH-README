Configurable pristine checksum kind in a working copy
-----------------------------------------------------

The implementation on the branch allows creating working copies that use a
checksum kind other than plain SHA-1.

The checksum kind is persisted in the settings table.  Upgraded working copies
of the older formats will have SHA-1 recorded as their pristine checksum kind
and will continue to use it for compatibility.  Newly created working copies
of the latest format (with --compatible-version=1.15 or --store-pristine=no),
as currently implemented, will use the new pristine checksum kind.

Dynamically salted SHA-1 checksums
----------------------------------

The implementation on the branch uses a dynamically salted SHA-1 checksum kind.
The dynamic salt is generated during the creation of a wc.db.
