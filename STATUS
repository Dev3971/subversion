 * r1835049, r1882326
   Fix issue #4762 "authz doesn't combine global and repository rules"
   Justification:
     Restore behaviour of SVN 1.9: It is now again possible to override
     per-path access rules for specific users (and groups) at the global
     level. Such global rules are overridden by repository-specific rules
     only if both the user and the path match the repository-specific rule.
