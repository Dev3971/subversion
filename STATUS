 * r1879198
   Fix an invalid quoting in working copy upgrade system that only works
   because SQLite automatically fixed this. More recent SQLite functions
   will signal an error when deprecated features are disabled.
   Note:
     This filechange by itself doesn't trigger a change that make will
     handle. So make sure you recompile the sql queries for testing.
